Those are my solutions to the exercises and challenges of [Thinkful][1]'s course [Fundamentals of Web Development][2] provided through Github's [Student Developer Pack][3]. The course is an introduction to frontend web development as well as standard tools like git.

The exercises are inside the [drills](drills) folder divided with the scheme unit.lesson.project. Challenges are divided as unit.lesson since there is one challenge per lesson.

The [quiz-app](challenges/3.2/quiz-app) (challenge 3.2) resides in its own repo and has been added in this one as submodule. Same with the capstone project (the entire 6.5) and optional projects of unit 3.

Actually it was usually asked for each exercise (and challenge) to be on their own repo by forking some base files from [Thinkful Ed](/Thinkful-Ed) but I found this to make a mess. As it can be seen there are numerous exercises. Repos are free to make but still a mess.
